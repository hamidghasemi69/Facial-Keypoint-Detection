# Facial-Keypoint-Detection

**Implementing Image Processing and Deep Learning Techniques for Facial Keypoint Detection**

This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect facial keypoints, utilizing image processing and deep learning tools. The model is trained to predict 68 facial landmarks, which can be used for various applications such as facial recognition, emotion detection, and augmented reality.
