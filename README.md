# Facial-Keypoint-Detection
Implementation of Image Processing and Deep Learning Tools to Create a CNN for Facial Keypoint Detection

# Project Overview: Detecting keypoints on faces:
In this project, I combined the techniques in computer vision and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predict the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications such as facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition.
